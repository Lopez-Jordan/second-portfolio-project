# second-portfolio-project

## Description 

For this project, I created a portfolio website that displayed my previous html and css projects. In this project, I focused on aesthetic via UI and creating the page responsively so it would work with all devices. This proved to be a large task because I wasn't super familiar with media queries or flexbox until now.
