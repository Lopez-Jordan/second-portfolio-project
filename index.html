            <h1>I'm Jordan Lopez</h1>
            <p>I'm a recent alumni from UC Santa Cruz where I majored in Economics and Mathematics.
                However, I've chosen to pursue the software engineering route. Currently, my SE skills
                include proficiency in python, java, javascript, html and css. This website challenged my
                abilities to make contents responsive, so mess around with the screen size to see how everything works!

                        In this group project, we used 2 crypto currency API's to dynamically 
                        generate data that contains metrics based off a user input portfolio.
                        It was really fun to make the UI/UX clean and utilize many libraries in conjunction 
                        with eachother!

                    <p class="right"><span class="titles">Longest Project:</span>    This website was my first comprehensive portfolio project.
                        My goals here were to put together basic html and css elements while
                        making the UI as aesthetic as possible. While it took over 5 days to make,
                        the responsiveness of the webpage is minimal. When  you resize the browser
                        all the conent gets jumbled into a big mess.

                        This project was mainly to test my html and css skills.
                        In class we were given about an hour to make a deployed 
                        webpage that met certain criteria. Given the allotted time, 
                        I whipped this baby up pretty fast which made me proud that my 
                        skills were increasing fast.

                        Ah yes, my first ever webpage!
                        As you can see (hopefully), it is not very advanced. That is
                        because it only has html! This project was important to me because
                        it showed me that with a little effort I can make webpages with little
                        coding knowledge.

                        In this project, I created a basic html and css 
                        webpage for my full-stack bootcamp. It's not super sentimental to me,
                        however, it does symbolize the beginning of a long 3-month all intensive journey.
